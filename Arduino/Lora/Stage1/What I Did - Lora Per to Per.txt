Stage one: (Lora Per to Per)
Description: Just needed to prove that the devices would communicate to one another.

Establish communication using two "FT232RL USB to Serial Mini USB to TTL Adapter Boards"

Open Arduino Serial monitor, set line return for New line and carriage
Baud to 115200

Send AT commands to initialize the device #1 (RYLR405 Connected to my Laptop)
Note: after each AT command you should see a response like: +OK
	AT
	AT+BAND=433000000
	AT+NETWORKID=7
	AT+ADDRESS=1
	AT+PARAMETER=10,7,1,7
	AT+CPIN=FABC0002EEDCAA90FABC0002EEDCAA90

Send AT commands to initialize the device #2 (RYLR405 Connected to my Ubuntu system Using RDP)
Note: after each AT command you should see a response like: +OK
	AT
	AT+BAND=433000000
	AT+NETWORKID=7
	AT+ADDRESS=2
	AT+PARAMETER=10,7,1,7
	AT+CPIN=FABC0002EEDCAA90FABC0002EEDCAA90

Send AT Message to device #1 from device #1 (RYLR405 Connected to my Laptop)
Note: After each AT+Send command you should see a response like: +OK on device #1
device #2 should print a message starting with +RCV such as +RCV=1,5,HELLO,-99,40

	AT+SEND=2,5,HELLO

Send AT Message to device #2 from device #1 (RYLR405 Connected to my Laptop)
Note: After each AT+Send command you should see a response like: +OK on device #2
device #1 should print a message starting with +RCV such as +RCV=2,5,HELLO,-99,40
	AT+SEND=1,5,HELLO

If failure occurs sent the following AT command and repeat the above.
Note: after each AT command you should see a responce like: +FACTORY

	AT+FACTORY
